## Why this matters

Running a local Kubernetes cluster on a Mac has always meant a quiet compromise. Your "nodes" were containers sharing one kernel inside one hidden Linux VM, all pretending to be separate machines. It worked until you tried to test a node failure, or `kubectl top`, or a `type: LoadBalancer` service, and the illusion cracked.

A Kubernetes node wants to *be* a machine: its own kernel, its own kubelet, its own cgroups, its own IP that can come and go on its own. **kiac gives every node exactly that** by booting each one as its own lightweight virtual machine on Apple's native runtime. The result is a local cluster that behaves like a real one, created with a single command in a couple of minutes.

## Why Apple containers

When Apple shipped `container` 1.0, most people read it as "Docker, but from Apple." It is something more interesting underneath: **every container is its own lightweight virtual machine.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/apple-container-anatomy.png" alt="How one Apple container works" width="92%">
</p>

The [Containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization) framework boots a separate, minimal Linux VM for each container on Apple's `Virtualization.framework`:

- **The image becomes a disk.** The OCI image is turned into an EXT4 filesystem and handed to the VM as its root block device. No overlay mount layered on a shared host kernel.
- **A dedicated kernel boots.** Each container gets its own minimal, optimized Linux kernel. It is not shared with the host or any other container.
- **`vminitd` is PID 1.** A tiny Swift init system comes up first, then launches and supervises your process. The host drives it through a gRPC API over `vsock`.
- **virtio devices, direct networking.** No BIOS, no legacy device emulation, so the VM boots in about a second and gets its own IP you can reach from your Mac.

You get the developer experience of containers with the isolation boundary of a virtual machine. That combination is exactly what a Kubernetes node wants.

## Why Kubernetes on Apple containers: real isolation

When local Kubernetes tools run "nodes" as Docker containers, those nodes are processes sharing one Linux kernel, separated only by namespaces. Namespaces are a software boundary *inside* a single shared kernel. With kiac, the boundary between nodes is the **hypervisor** itself.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/isolation.png" alt="Where the isolation boundary sits" width="100%">
</p>

That difference is not academic. It changes what the cluster can actually do:

- **Blast radius.** A container escape that reaches the shared kernel reaches every node on it. With a VM per node, an escape is contained to one VM.
- **Failure domains.** A shared kernel is a shared fate: one panic or runaway sysctl takes everything down together. With kiac, a kernel problem stays inside the VM that caused it.
- **Real node failure.** Stop one node VM and it behaves like an actual node going offline: NotReady detection, eviction, rescheduling. You cannot meaningfully test that when "stopping a node" means killing one of several processes that share a kernel.
- **Per-node kernel reality.** Each node has its own `/proc`, `/sys`, modules, and sysctls. Node-level behavior is real, not simulated.

Containers are great for packaging software, and kiac depends on them. The point is narrower: when the workload you are isolating is itself a machine, a machine-grade boundary is the right tool.

## Features

- 🔒 **Hardware-grade isolation** — each node is one lightweight VM with its own kernel and cgroups, not namespaces sharing a daemon.
- 📊 **Metrics out of the box** — `kubectl top nodes` works the moment the cluster is up. metrics-server ships preconfigured.
- 💾 **PVCs that just bind** — a default StorageClass (local-path-provisioner) is installed on create, so StatefulSets and `volumeClaimTemplates` work immediately.
- **Host bind mounts** — repeatable `--mount` options expose macOS directories at matching paths in every kubeadm or k3s node, ready for Kubernetes `hostPath` volumes.
- ⚖️ **`type: LoadBalancer` works** — kiac-lb ships by default: a tiny systemd loop inside the control-plane VM assigns node IPs to Services in about two seconds, shares one IP across Services when ports don't collide, and heals itself after node restarts. No pods, no webhooks, no `<pending>`, no tunnels.
- 🌐 **Direct networking** — every node gets a routable IP on macOS 26+. Hit NodePorts directly with no required port mapping; a tiny embedded node-local edge proxy terminates external TCP first so large uploads from sibling VMs do not hit vmnet's TSO forwarding bug.
- 🧱 **Multi-node, day one** — `--workers N` gives a real topology: scheduling, cross-node pod networking, node failures you can practice on.
- ⚡ **Two distros** — kubeadm on `kindest/node` by default, or `--distro k3s` for `rancher/k3s` as PID 1 in every VM: sqlite datastore, a 2-node cluster in 22-54 seconds, about 3.7GB of host memory total.
- 🐝 **Cilium and eBPF, one flag pair** — `--cni cilium --kernel full` downloads a published, sha-pinned kernel build (VXLAN, eBPF, br_netfilter) and drives the official Cilium installer. Cross-node pod traffic runs at ~285MB/s and Mac-to-pod at ~1GB/s on Cilium's vxlan datapath.
- **Real Apple GPU nodes (alpha)** — `--gpu-workers N` creates krunkit-backed worker VMs with the Mac's Apple GPU exposed through virtio-gpu/Venus. Kubernetes advertises only the honest `kiac.dev/gpu` resource through a device plugin or DRA; `kiac gpu bench` proves the Vulkan path with a pinned llama.cpp workload and can compare it with native Metal.
- 🔁 **Clusters survive reboots** — `kiac resume cluster` restarts kubeadm or k3s VMs after a host reboot and heals every stale control-plane, node, kubeconfig, and networking address. It is idempotent and upgrades existing k3s clusters in place.
- 📈 **Observability built in** — `--observability` installs Prometheus and Grafana on a real LoadBalancer IP, with Cluster Overview and Nodes dashboards already provisioned.
- 🌍 **IPv6 and dual-stack** — `--ip-family dual` (or `ipv6`) gives pods, Services, and nodes real IPv6, with kube-proxy programming IPv6 ClusterIP/NodePort/LoadBalancer rules on the full kernel. kiac-lb hands out both families, the edge proxy fixes v6 large uploads too, and `kiac resume` heals both. See [docs/design/ipv6-dual-stack.md](docs/design/ipv6-dual-stack.md).
- 🚪 **Gateway API built in** — `--gateway` installs the Gateway API CRDs and Traefik with a ready-to-use GatewayClass and Gateway, so an HTTPRoute works out of the box.
- 💥 **Node chaos you can trust** — `kiac stop node` / `kiac start node` stop and restart a real node VM: NotReady detection, eviction, rescheduling, rejoin.
- **Diagnostics with an exit code** — `kiac verify cluster` checks the VM, Kubernetes, DNS, storage, metrics, edge proxy, LoadBalancer, Gateway, observability, and host API paths without changing the cluster. JSON output is stable for automation; `kiac support bundle` writes a bounded, redacted archive for issue reports.
- 📄 **Declarative clusters** — `kiac create cluster --config cluster.yaml` describes the whole cluster in one file; explicit flags override it.
- 🖥️ **A console when you want one** — `kiac ui` opens a local web console: cluster cards, live resource bars, node stop/start buttons, Grafana and Gateway links, a create form, and a per-cluster kubectl Console drawer (loopback-only, no shell). Works on every distro. Same engine as the CLI.
- 🍎 **Native stack** — one Swift runtime from Apple, one Go binary from us. Coexists with Docker Desktop, kind, and k3d; never touches the Docker socket.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

- An Apple silicon Mac
- macOS 26+ for multi-node clusters (single-node works on macOS 15, with limitations)
- [apple/container](https://github.com/apple/container/releases) 1.0.0+ (1.2.0 is incompatible; use 1.2.1 or newer)
- `kubectl`

GPU clusters additionally require [krunkit](https://github.com/libkrun/krunkit) 1.3.2+ and [vmnet-helper](https://github.com/nirs/vmnet-helper) 0.13.0+. These are loaded only when `--gpu-workers` is used, so ordinary cluster startup and resource use are unchanged.

### Install

```bash
brew install --cask saiyam1814/tap/kiac
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods</summary>

```bash
# With Go
go install github.com/saiyam1814/kiac@latest

# From source
git clone https://github.com/saiyam1814/kiac && cd kiac && make build
```
</details>

### Verify a release

Every release includes SHA-256 checksums and an SPDX SBOM. GitHub also signs build provenance for each artifact, and published releases are immutable.

```bash
gh release download vX.Y.Z --repo saiyam1814/kiac --dir kiac-release
(cd kiac-release && shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt)
gh attestation verify kiac-release/kiac_X.Y.Z_darwin_arm64.tar.gz --repo saiyam1814/kiac
gh release verify vX.Y.Z --repo saiyam1814/kiac
```

### Create your first cluster

```bash
kiac doctor                                  # check your setup
kiac create cluster --name dev --workers 2   # 1 control plane + 2 workers
```

```text
⬢ kiac · Kubernetes in Apple Containers
 ✓ Preflight checks (0.3s)
 ✓ Pulling node image kindest/node:v1.37.0 (8.4s)
 ✓ Booting 3 node VM(s) (9.8s)
 ✓ Initializing Kubernetes control plane (49.6s)
 ✓ Joining 2 worker(s) (13.5s)
 ✓ Installing CNI (kindnet) (0.4s)
 ✓ Installing addons (storage, metrics-server) (0.5s)
 ✓ Installing LoadBalancer (kiac-lb) (1.1s)
 ✓ Waiting for nodes to be Ready (10.7s)
 ✓ Labeling LoadBalancer primary node (0.3s)
 ✓ Installing edge proxy (large upload fix) (0.8s)
 ✓ Writing kubeconfig (0.2s)

Cluster "dev" is ready in 1m35s. Every node is its own lightweight VM.
```

The kubeconfig is merged into `~/.kube/config` as context `kiac-dev` (your existing config is backed up to `~/.kube/config.kiac.bak` the first time).

### Pick a flavor

```bash
# k3s nodes: rancher/k3s as PID 1 in every VM, a 2-node cluster in under a minute
kiac create cluster --name quick --distro k3s --workers 1

# Cilium with eBPF on the full node kernel (needs the Cilium CLI: brew install cilium-cli)
kiac create cluster --name ebpf --workers 2 --cni cilium --kernel full
```

`--kernel full` downloads a published, sha-pinned kernel build once (cached in `~/.kiac/kernels`) and boots every node on it. A full Cilium cluster with `--observability --gateway` comes up in about 1m37s.

### Turn everything on

```bash
kiac create cluster --name dev --workers 2 --observability --gateway
```

One command later you have Grafana at port 3000 on a real LoadBalancer IP (anonymous admin, local-only, two dashboards already provisioned) and a Gateway serving HTTP on port 80, also on a LoadBalancer IP. Point an HTTPRoute at `parentRefs: [{name: kiac, namespace: kiac-gateway}]` and it routes with zero extra setup; see [`examples/gateway-api-lab.md`](examples/gateway-api-lab.md), [`examples/observability-lab.md`](examples/observability-lab.md), and [`examples/httproute.yaml`](examples/httproute.yaml). The same two flags work on kubeadm, k3s, and Cilium clusters.

### Run a real Apple GPU workload (alpha)

```bash
brew tap libkrun/krun
brew trust libkrun/krun
brew install krunkit

# vmnet-helper on macOS 26+
brew tap nirs/vmnet-helper
brew trust nirs/vmnet-helper
brew install vmnet-helper
kiac gpu doctor
kiac create cluster --name gpu-lab --distro k3s --workers 1 \
  --gpu-workers 1 --gpu-resource-driver dra
kubectl apply -f examples/gpu-vulkan.yaml
kubectl logs -f pod/kiac-gpu-vulkan
```

On macOS 14 or 15, install vmnet-helper with its [upstream installer and sudoers setup](https://github.com/nirs/vmnet-helper#installation) instead of Homebrew. If krunkit was previously installed from `slp/krunkit` or `slp/krun`, remove that legacy tap first by following the [current driver migration instructions](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/krunkit/). Kiac still recognizes a working legacy `slp/krun` renderer installation, but new installs should use `libkrun/krun`.

A GPU cluster uses krunkit for its complete VM topology so every node shares one reliable network. Only `-gpu-N` workers publish a schedulable GPU resource and mount `/dev/dri` into GPU pods; ordinary clusters continue to use the faster apple/container backend. LoadBalancer Services, Gateway API, observability, storage, node stop/start, resume, verify, and support bundles use the same Kiac lifecycle paths.

This is real Apple GPU access through virtio-gpu/Venus and Vulkan, not CUDA compatibility. Krunkit currently exposes Venus to every VM in a GPU cluster, but Kiac publishes schedulable inventory and mounts `/dev/dri` into allocated workloads only for `-gpu-N` workers. Kiac does not advertise `nvidia.com/gpu`, and CUDA, NVML, `nvidia-smi`, Metal, and MLX are unavailable inside Linux pods. Follow the [complete GPU and inference lab](examples/gpu-lab.md) for DRA memory requests, pinned inference workloads, compatibility rewrites, and a native Metal-versus-Venus benchmark.

`kiac gpu bench` uses four CPU threads for both backends and records the reported llama.cpp build IDs, GPU identity, and timing variability. The host binary is not version-pinned: differing build IDs mean the comparison cannot isolate virtualization overhead. Each run owns a temporary, uniquely labelled pod in the `default` namespace; cleanup does not target another run's pod.

### Run Portainer CE on kiac

This example installs Portainer Community Edition as an optional application inside a kiac Kubernetes cluster. Portainer is not bundled with kiac and adds nothing to normal cluster startup or idle resource use. Community Edition does not require a license key; Portainer Business Edition does.

```bash
./examples/portainer.sh up
./examples/portainer.sh verify
./examples/portainer.sh cleanup
```

The script pins Portainer CE `2.39.5` and chart `239.5.0`, waits for its PVC and LoadBalancer address, authenticates with the generated admin credential, registers the kiac cluster in Portainer, and reads the cluster's nodes through Portainer's Kubernetes API proxy. The complete workflow was rerun against the released `kiac v0.5.0`; see [Run Portainer CE on kiac](https://saiyam1814.github.io/kiac/docs/portainer.html) or [`examples/portainer-lab.md`](examples/portainer-lab.md).

### Run Rancher on kiac

This example installs open-source Rancher Manager on a dedicated kiac cluster. Rancher is optional and requires no license key. The script uses kiac's Gateway API addon, generates local TLS and protected bootstrap credentials, and keeps Rancher's cluster-wide resources inside an isolated cluster with unambiguous cleanup.

```bash
./examples/rancher.sh up
./examples/rancher.sh verify
./examples/rancher.sh cleanup
```

Rancher Manager and its stable chart are pinned to `2.14.3` on Kubernetes `1.34`. The verifier reaches the dashboard through the HTTPS Gateway, authenticates to the live API, confirms the server version, waits for Rancher's local cluster to become active, and lists its node. See [Run Rancher on kiac](https://saiyam1814.github.io/kiac/docs/rancher.html) or [`examples/rancher-lab.md`](examples/rancher-lab.md).

The [integration labs](https://saiyam1814.github.io/kiac/docs/labs.html) also cover Gateway API, observability, k8gb failover, OpenChoreo, node failure, and reboot recovery.

kiac doctor --fix                            # ...and auto-start the container service
kiac create cluster                          # single node, everything included

kiac resume cluster --name dev               # bring a cluster back after a host reboot; idempotent
kiac verify cluster --name dev               # read-only end-to-end health checks
kiac verify cluster --name dev -o json       # stable schema + nonzero exit on required failures
kiac support bundle --name dev               # redacted diagnostic archive for an issue
kiac gpu doctor                              # check the optional krunkit/Venus toolchain
kiac gpu status --name gpu-lab               # inspect GPU nodes, resources, and driver health
kiac gpu bench --name gpu-lab                # compare pinned Venus inference with host Metal
kiac gpu values vllm                         # print scheduling values, with compatibility caveats
kiac gpu compat enable --name gpu-lab --namespace demo # opt-in legacy resource rewrite
container build -t myapp:dev .               # build with apple/container
kiac load image myapp:dev --name dev         # push it into every node
kiac completion zsh                          # bash|zsh|fish|powershell; see kiac completion -h
kiac delete cluster --name dev
```

One honest caveat is tracked upstream in apple/container's vmnet layer: after `kiac stop node` + `kiac start node`, new TCP connections from your Mac to that one restarted VM can drop. In-cluster traffic keeps working, reboot plus `kiac resume` is unaffected, and the default edge proxy handles the separate large-upload TSO path for NodePort and LoadBalancer traffic. Details and workarounds live in the docs troubleshooting page.

Full guides and command reference live on the [docs site](https://saiyam1814.github.io/kiac/).

`create cluster`, `delete cluster`, `get clusters`, and `get nodes` reject extra positional arguments. Select a cluster with `--name` where supported, for example `kiac delete cluster --name dev`, rather than `kiac delete cluster dev`. Creation requires a positive `--wait` duration. K3s also accepts full release versions such as `v1.36.4+k3s1` or `v1.36.4-k3s1`, preserving an explicit K3s build revision.

### Flags for `create cluster`

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--name` | `dev` | cluster name |
| `--workers` | `0` | worker count; control plane is untainted when 0 |
| `--gpu-workers` | `0` | real Apple GPU workers (alpha); switches the complete cluster topology to krunkit while only `-gpu-N` workers publish GPU inventory |
| `--gpu-image` | `fedora-44` | verified GPU VM base image alias or a local raw ARM64 cloud-disk path |
| `--gpu-disk-size` | `20G` | persistent disk size for each krunkit-backed node |
| `--gpu-resource-driver` | `device-plugin` | Kubernetes resource publication: `device-plugin`, or `dra` on Kubernetes 1.36+ |
| `--k8s-version` | distro latest | Kubernetes minor; kubeadm defaults to 1.37 (pins 1.32-1.37), k3s defaults to 1.36 (pins 1.32-1.36) |
| `--distro` | `kubeadm` | `kubeadm` or `k3s`; ordinary k3s replaces Flannel with kindnet, while GPU k3s uses bundled Flannel on krunkit's capable kernel; `--cni` does not apply to k3s |
| `--image` | resolved from `--k8s-version` | explicit node image override |
| `--cni` | `kindnet` | kubeadm pod network: `kindnet`, `cilium`, or `none`; Cilium needs the host CLI and, on ordinary apple/container clusters, `--kernel full` |
| `--kernel` | Apple's stock kernel | `full` downloads the published kiac kernel (VXLAN, Geneve, br_netfilter, eBPF, WireGuard; sha-pinned, cached in `~/.kiac/kernels`), or pass a path to a kernel Image |
| `--dns` | runtime default | nameserver IPs for the node VMs, repeatable up to 3 (resolv.conf's own limit); given, it replaces the runtime's default resolv.conf entirely rather than adding to it |
| `--mount` | | bind a host directory into every node VM; repeat `type=bind,source=/host/path,target=/node/path[,readonly]`. Explicit CLI mounts replace config-file mounts |
| `-p`, `--publish` | | publish host localhost traffic to the control-plane VM using apple/container syntax `[host-ip:]host-port:container-port[/protocol]`; repeatable |
| `--cpus` | `4` | vCPUs per node VM |
| `--memory` | `2G` | memory per worker VM (idle workers use a few hundred MB) |
| `--cp-memory` | `4G` | memory for the control-plane VM (etcd, apiserver, and on single-node clusters every addon) |
| `--no-metrics` | `false` | skip metrics-server |
| `--no-storage` | `false` | skip the local-path default StorageClass |
| `--ip-family` | `ipv4` | address families: `ipv4`, `dual` (IPv4+IPv6), or `ipv6` (v6-primary, kubeadm only). Non-ipv4 auto-selects `--kernel full` and needs macOS 26+ |
| `--no-lb` | `false` | skip kiac-lb (`type: LoadBalancer` support) |
| `--no-edge-proxy` | `false` | skip the node-local edge proxy that fixes large TCP uploads through NodePorts and LoadBalancers |
| `--observability` | `false` | install Prometheus + Grafana + node-exporter; Grafana uses a LoadBalancer IP or ClusterIP with `--no-lb` |
| `--gateway` | `false` | install Gateway API CRDs + Traefik with a ready-to-use GatewayClass and Gateway |
| `--config` | | cluster config YAML (see [`examples/cluster.yaml`](examples/cluster.yaml)); flags set explicitly on the command line override file values (`--kernel` is flag-only) |
| `--wait` | `5m` | positive timeout for each readiness step, including CNI installation; zero and negative values are rejected |

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="How kiac builds a cluster" width="100%">
</p>

For ordinary clusters, Kiac drives the `apple/container` CLI to boot one lightweight VM per node from the standard `kindest/node` image (systemd, containerd, kubeadm preinstalled), initializes the control plane with `kubeadm`, joins workers over the `vmnet` network, and installs the selected CNI and addons. With `--distro k3s`, the VMs run `rancher/k3s` as PID 1 instead. `--kernel full` boots apple/container nodes on a published kernel build with the features overlay and eBPF CNIs need.

On systemd-backed nodes, `kiac resume cluster` repairs stale edge-proxy API credentials without replacing the tunnel token. Healthy proxies with current credentials stay running; interrupted updates remain retryable. Support bundles collect these proxies' journald logs, while ordinary K3s proxies keep their file-based logs.

GPU mode is deliberately opt-in. When `--gpu-workers` is nonzero, Kiac builds the complete cluster on krunkit and vmnet-helper so control-plane, ordinary-worker, and GPU-worker traffic stays on one reliable VM network. Only `-gpu-N` workers expose `/dev/dri` to selected pods and publish `kiac.dev/gpu`, through either a device plugin or Kubernetes DRA. The same cluster manager owns inventory, delete, stop/start, resume, networking, storage, LoadBalancer, Gateway, observability, verify, and support operations across both backends. Neither mode touches the Docker socket, so Kiac coexists with Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, kind, and k3d.

Host bind mounts use ordinary `container run`, not `container machine`; `/Users` is therefore not shared automatically. A configured mount is attached independently to every node and remains attached when that container is stopped and started or resumed. See [Storage & metrics](https://saiyam1814.github.io/kiac/docs/storage-and-metrics.html#host-bind-mounts) for the required Kubernetes `hostPath` layer and security implications.

## Roadmap

- **Persistence backed by `container machine`** (WWDC26 persistent Linux environments): `kiac resume` already brings a cluster back after a reboot, and machine-backed VMs would make that instant
- **HA control planes**
- **One-flag Calico and Flannel** on the full kernel
- **Hubble UI** for Cilium clusters
- **Standalone Apple GPU driver packaging** with a stable API shared outside Kiac
- **Multi-Mac GPU pools and stricter per-workload GPU memory enforcement** after the local alpha contracts settle

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome, from typo fixes to new addons. A good way in: try the configs in [`examples/`](examples/), read the [docs site](https://saiyam1814.github.io/kiac/), and open an issue for anything that surprised you. If you want to build something bigger, open an issue first so we can agree on the shape.

## Credits

kiac stands on other people's work: the [`apple/container`](https://github.com/apple/container) and [Containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization) teams at Apple built the everyday runtime; Akihiro Suda's [`kina`](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/kina) proved Kubernetes on `apple/container` was viable; and the node experience reuses the [`kindest/node`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) image from the kind project. Real Apple GPU nodes build on [`libkrun`](https://github.com/libkrun/libkrun), [`krunkit`](https://github.com/libkrun/krunkit), [`vmnet-helper`](https://github.com/nirs/vmnet-helper), virglrenderer, Mesa's Venus driver, and MoltenVK.
